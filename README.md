# Make HTTP requests from inside WASM in Lua (implemented in Golang)

**Note:** if you are interested in "classic", C-based Lua implementations like Wasmoon, see [this project](https://github.com/wasm-outbound-http-examples/lua).


This devcontainer is configured to provide you a latest stable version of Go toolset.

Example in `browser-gluahttp` directory allows you to build a `gluahttp` sample yourself and experiment with it.
For details, see its [README](browser-gluahttp/README.md).
